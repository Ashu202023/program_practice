In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multi-threading is not suitable for CPU-bound tasks where multiple threads need to execute Python bytecodes concurrently. The GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecodes at a time, which can limit the performance improvement in CPU-bound scenarios.

In the scenario described, where computations are time-consuming and the message fetching involves network operations, the Global Interpreter Lock would likely diminish the potential benefits of using multiple threads. Here's why:

1. **GIL Limitation:** The GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode concurrently. If the computations are CPU-bound, the GIL will serialize the execution of threads, limiting the advantages of parallelism.

2. **I/O-Bound Operations:** If the computations involve I/O-bound operations such as network requests (like fetching a message), threading can be more effective because the GIL is released during I/O operations. However, the GIL can still impact performance in certain scenarios.

Considering the given scenario, the single-threaded approach, where calculations are performed first and then the message is fetched, might be more straightforward and potentially more efficient. The single-threaded approach avoids the complexities introduced by the GIL and ensures that each operation (calculations and message fetching) is executed sequentially without contention for the GIL.

For scenarios involving significant CPU-bound computations, and especially in Python, alternative approaches like multiprocessing or using asynchronous I/O might be more suitable to fully leverage the capabilities of modern multi-core processors and handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.
